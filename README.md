# Realistic Rendering Techniques on Parametric Surfaces

The project uses jQuery for UI interactions.

To run the project put the files into a http host. If you run the index.html directly, the browser may give the following exception:
"from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https."

This happens because I followed ES6 rules for javascript. The project designed as modular.

If you run the project with Chrome browser, you can bypass CORS policy by using the following argument:
"--allow-file-access-from-files"
